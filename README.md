## CS 530: Internet, Web, and Cloud Systems

## Description
This repository contains my lab assignments and final project for CS 530.

---

## Final Project
My final project for this class was an application that uses Google's Task API to add tasks to the user's Google Calendar/Task List to remind them to contact people at user specified intervals (and provides extremely silly conversation prompts). 
The applicaton was written in python, containerized using Docker, and hosted and managed using Google Cloud services. The focus of this project was to use cloud services and integrate with APIs, thusly, it is not my most aesthetically pleasing project.
